#### Key Dependencies:
1. **Backend Framework**: The project uses **Express.js**, which is a popular web framework for Node.js.
2. **Authentication**: The project includes **jsonwebtoken** for token-based authentication and **bcryptjs** for password hashing.
3. **Database**: It integrates **Mongoose**, which is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
4. **Environment Management**: The project uses **dotenv** for managing environment variables.
5. **Firebase Integration**: Firebase services are included, such as:
   - Authentication (`@firebase/auth`)
